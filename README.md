Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality industry, providing travelers with a wide range of accommodation options. This study focuses on analyzing the Airbnb listings in New York City (NYC), one of the platform's largest and most active markets. Using a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb properties across NYCâ€™s five boroughs, the analysis aims to uncover insights into key factors such as pricing trends, availability, customer reviews, and geographic distribution of listings. The research investigates how factors like location, property type, and host reputation influence booking rates and overall demand. It also examines the impact of Airbnb on the local rental market and explores the relationship between user ratings and the quality of accommodations. The findings provide valuable insights for both potential hosts and travelers, helping to optimize pricing strategies, identify high-demand areas, and understand customer preferences within the competitive NYC market. This study serves as a foundation for broader explorations into the economic and social effects of short-term rentals in urban environments.
